# Motivation ðŸ’ª

Everyday in the evening you have your dinner ready and are set to watch something, but you keep scrolling through your OTT platform for 30-45 min just to find that one thing to watch. Same here. I thought why to use this brain power for such mere tasks. So here is **what to watch today**. Just click one button and watch whatever comes up. It's fun and exciting and gives you something to look forward to everyday (not that i recommend wasting your time watching movies everyday).

# About Project

The project is a SPA which helps you in deciding what to watch today. It randomly finds a movie or a show for you to watch thus removing the burden of spending hours selecting something to watch. There are 2 modes which you can use: 
- **Surprise me :** Completely random in the selection of the content, if you are in an adventurous mood.
- **I'll Tailor it :** If you have an idea or prefernce of what type of content you are interested in watching today you can set your preferences and it'll recommend you something that you'll like.
