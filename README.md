# Motivation ðŸ’ª

Everyday in the evening you have your dinner ready and are set to watch something, but you keep scrolling through your OTT platform for 30-45 min just to find that one thing to watch. Same here. I thought why to use this brain power for such mere tasks. So here is **what to watch today**. Just click one button and watch whatever comes up. It's fun and exciting and gives you something to look forward to everyday (not that i recommend wasting your time watching movies everyday).
